                        My Name is Geordin Soucie and this is my GitHub React Portfolio.
                        You can see the projects in the portfolio <Link to="/home">Here</Link>.

                        <p>I am finishing up a Web Development Bootcamp with the University of Richmond.
                        As a student soon to be entering the job market I created this site to show off my portfolio.
                        I am focusing on my final project so the site may be a bit basic right now.
                 </p>
                    </div>
                    <div className="col-4">
                        <h5>Here are a few interesting links</h5>
                       <p><a href="https://gormthewyrm.github.io/">My Github Portal Page</a> <br />
                       This links to my standard Github Pages webpage. It is a little more polished (right now),
                       and has a decent explaination of web development for all of my friends outside of the field.
