                        <p>
                        Geordin Soucie grew up in rural Massachusetts in a time when the internet was confined to more
                        populated areas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The son of an IT network professional and interior design specialist, Geordin developed an
                        interest in design at an early age.
                    </p>
                    <p>However, it was not until his junior year in college that he first discovered the joy of coding.
                        An Intro to Computer Science class at Clarkson University taught Geordin the joy of C++.
                    </p>
                    <p>In 2019, after determining that the Park Service demanded too many weekend hours,
                        Geordin signed up for a Web Development Bootcamp through the University of Richmond
                        He graduated in August 2020 in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic and began to seek more
                        permanent employment.
